╚ About Updates ╝

I always add or update things when I have time or have coded new things

╚ AutoFarm Info ╝

the 2 most important things are

1. You always have to be in the game, don't minimize or go to another tab/window, otherwise the packages won't be delivered correctly

2. If You disable the autofarm you will get kicked to disable the autofarm so wait until you get payed if you want the money

also

3. Most of the auto farm was made from the heart so deliver package and equip package and get House position and you often fell through the map (after the house update because the auto farm was made 2-3 days before the update) which I fixed (McletsHacks)

4. In the premium version the autofarm will repeat 1000 times so you can go sleep ( and let the window open don't minimize ) and if you wake up you rich xd
